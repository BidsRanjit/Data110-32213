News media has historically produced its fair share of misleading data visualizations. As the importance of data visualization gains recognition, the frequency of such errors appears to be on the decline. Nonetheless, vigilant observers can still spot significant mistakes in the data visualizations presented by news outlets. For example,

- [The most misleading charts of 2015, fixed](http://qz.com/580859/the-most-misleading-charts-of-2015-fixed/)

The book delves into the intriguing concept of shaping perception through the strategic selection of the vertical axis's range, specifically by avoiding the default of starting at zero. However, this approach shouldn't be adhered to as an unbreakable rule. For a more nuanced understanding of this topic, the Vox video titled "Shut up about the y-axis. It shouldn’t always start at zero" offers a compelling explanation that highlights why this is the case.
