In this week we will gove the topic below:

- We discussed aesthetic mappings in our session which we took from chapter two of the book [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/aesthetic-mapping.html), emphasizing how each plot possesses unique characteristics that can be categorized into specific elements. When creating a plot for our data, it's crucial to make deliberate decisions regarding these aesthetic elements to enhance our visual representation. Gaining experience and observing others' work are effective strategies to identify best practices and select the most suitable aesthetic elements for your plots.

- To effectively visualize data, first and foremost, we need access to data. But where does this data come from? There are several methods to acquire data for analysis and visualization:

1. **Manually Inputting Data**: Entering data by hand, suitable for small datasets.
2. **Utilizing NumPy**: Generating synthetic data through NumPy for simulation or testing purposes.
3. **Reading External Data with Pandas**: Leveraging Pandas to import data from various external sources, such as CSV files, Excel sheets, or databases.
4. **Accessing Data Through APIs**: For more advanced scenarios, using APIs to fetch real-time or specialized data from online services or databases.
