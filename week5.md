In week 5, we explored Chapter 7: Visualizing Distributions from the book Fundamentals of Data Visualization, focusing on techniques for visualizing distributions. Our practical application involved analyzing the Titanic Dataset.

This dataset is readily available on GitHub. We specifically investigated the distribution of ages based on gender, examining both the overall distribution and the distributions among male and female passengers.

Throughout our analysis, we employed two primary visualization techniques: histograms and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE). If you'd like to delve deeper into the concept of KDE, I recommend watching the following YouTube video to learn more about Density Curve and its properties:

This video provides valuable insights into density curves and their properties, offering a deeper understanding of the KDE technique we utilized in our analysis.

### Week 6 Reading Assignment
