## Week Two Recap: Diving into the World of Data Visualization

### Inspiration Behind Our Dataset's Graph Design
The graph design of our dataset is inspired by the iconic visual from Joy Division's 1979 album, "Unknown Pleasures." This design has influenced a wide array of designers and data visualization enthusiasts.

### A Journey Through Data Visualization History
We explored "A Brief History of Data Visualization" by Michael Friendly to understand the evolution and milestones in visualizing data.

### The Importance of Data Visualization: Anscombe's Quartet
Anscombe's quartet consists of four datasets that have the same statistical properties but different distributions, highlighting the importance of visualizing data.

### Further Exploration in Data Visualization
We watched "Same Stats, Different Graphs - CHI 2017," emphasizing the significance of visual representation in data.

### Additional Resources for Insight
We examined resources that provide insights into data correlations and their visual representations.

### A Powerful Visualization Example
We reviewed a New York Times article as an excellent example of meaningful data visualization.

### Exploratory vs. Explanatory Visualization: A Comparative Study
We compared Exploratory Visualization (used for analyzing and understanding data) with Explanatory Visualization (used for communicating findings or narrating a story).

#### Examples:
- [Map of Reddit](https://anvaka.github.io/map-of-reddit/?x=19992.255291973044&y=21168.629572051443&z=6703.234703310886&v=2) (Exploratory)
- [The Fallen of World War II](http://www.fallen.io/ww2/) (Explanatory)
- [538: Various Sports Analyses](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) (Explanatory)

**Question of the Week:**
"In data-driven fields, do business analysts primarily use exploratory visualization while data scientists lean towards explanatory visualization for definitive insights?"

This concludes our insightful second week, where we deepened our understanding of the impactful world of data visualization. Looking forward to next week's explorations!
