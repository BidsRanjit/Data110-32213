## Week 4 Overview:  Jupyter for Data Science

This week, we've explored the significance of Jupyter Notebooks and IDEs like VS Code and Sublime for data science, emphasizing the interactive environment Jupyter provides for effective learning and application.

## Week 4 Assignment: Web Scraping for Box Office Data

**Objective:** Use web scraping techniques to collect box office data, process it with pandas, and create visualizations.

**Instructions:**

1. **Web Scraping:** Extract box office data from the web. ( this already done for you but you can play with it and see how it work)
2. **Data Processing:** Convert this data into a pandas DataFrame. ( this one done too but we maybe need it in future, so make sure you understand it)
3. **Visualization Task:** Create a bar graph to visualize the relationship between the movie `Title` and its `Weekend Gross` earnings. After creating the graph, add a text cell below it in your Jupyter Notebook to share your reflections on the visualization.

    Reflect on aspects such as clarity, information conveyance, and any patterns or insights that the graph reveals about the dataset.

**Resources:** Refer to "W4_HW_Scraping_Box_Office_Data.ipynb" for detailed instructions.

### Submission:

- **Format:** Complete the assignment in a Jupyter Notebook.
- **MS Teams:** Upload your notebook (.ipynb file) to the designated area.
- **GitHub:** Commit your completed notebook to your GitHub repository.
